#### Live At: https://care-finder.vercel.app/

CareFinder is a Centralized Medical Appointment System for users based in Nigeria, focused on enabling users book appointments with specialists Physicians in Hospitals Closest to them with ease.

## Inspiration
This Project was built for a Hackathon. It was built to help users easily locate and book appointments with hospitals/Pharmacies.

## What it does
CareFinder helps connect users with specialist in hospitals or pharmacies closet to them.
It allows users to be able to book appointments with specialists either In Person or Video call appointments.
For In Person Appointments, users are able to download or print out their apppointment slip which can then be presented at the hospital/Pharmacy of their choosing.
For Video Call Appointments, A video call meeting will be created for the user and specialist, and the link will be sent to both parties

## How it was built
For the Frontend We made use of NextJS, Javascript and CSS. The app also has some backend functionalities. For that we made use of Firebase to setup User Authentication and also store some user data. The Front End was deployed on Vercel.

## Challenges We Ran Into
One issue we faced was working with the google maps API. Since one on our team had worked with it before and the documentations were not really straight forward, we had to conduct an extensive reasearch on the task, but we finally decided to go with the `@react-google-maps/api` package to integrate google maps functionality to out application.

## Accomplishments we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to make use of tools that we haven't used before and come together to accomplish what we set for in a relatively short period of time.

## What We learned
We Leart many new technologies and skills like how to structure projects in a better way and how to effectively work in a team. We also strengthend our expertise on some of our existing skills like integrating Firebase to a web app and creating responsive carousels with swiper JS.

## Whats Next for Care Finder
We hope to expand our services to more people in the future and look for ways to increase our app scalability. We'd also like to pitch our app to existing Hospitals or clinics that may be in need of a similar system setup for their business.
